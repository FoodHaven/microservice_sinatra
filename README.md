The original intended use of this API is as a microservice for consumption by other component services of the Food Haven web application. This application was build using Ruby 3.2.2 and Rails 7.0.6

# Features
* Exposes 4 endpoints that return various subsets of farmers market info as JSON
* Stores the farmers markets in a Postgresql database.
